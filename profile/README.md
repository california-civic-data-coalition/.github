The California Civic Data Coalition is an open-source network of journalists and computer programmers from news organizations across America.

The coalition was formed in 2014 by [Ben Welsh](https://palewi.re/who-is-ben-welsh/) and Agustin Armendariz to lead the development of open-source software that makes California's public data easier to access and analyze. The effort has drawn hundreds of contributions from developers and journalists at dozens of news organizations.

The group helped open up the jumbled, difficult database tracking campaign finance and lobbying activity in state politics. That work resulted in [improved](https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-antonio-villaraigosa-charter-school-money-governor-20180514-story.html) [coverage](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/16/16658358/vape-lobby-vaping-health-risks-nicotine-big-tobacco-marketing) [of](https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-newsom-cannabis-20170727-story.html) [the topic](https://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-pol-brown-money-20141031-story.html), including some of the most [comprehensive](https://www.latimes.com/projects/props-california-2020-election-money/) and [probing](https://www.latimes.com/projects/props-california-2020-election-money/) analysis ever done of money at the statehouse.

Funded in part by a [Knight News Challenge grant](https://www.californiacivicdata.org/2015/07/22/knight-news-challenge/), the coalition’s effort has also yielded a [groundbreaking tool](https://www.californiacivicdata.org/2017/09/05/django-postgres-copy-2/) for database imports and [data journalism curriculum](https://www.firstpythonnotebook.org/about/index.html) that has been taught in classrooms and conferences around the world.

The repositories once stored in this organization have been relocated to [Welsh’s GitHub account](https://github.com/palewire).
